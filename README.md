# AES-GCM Password Based Encryption & Decryption for Java and Python

## Overview:
This repository holds two implementations for the AES-GCM password based encryption and decryption algorithm, both for Java and Python, that work together perfectly. It has been configured to do so. Most of the parameters as iterations, byte lengths or such must have the same values in both implementations in order to work between them.

## Usecases:
Suitable for cases like to APIs, one in Java and the other in Python.

## Testing:
In the main java class there is a method to test how it works.

## Locations:
The python script is located at [src/main/resources/encryptor.py](src/main/resources/encryptor.py)
